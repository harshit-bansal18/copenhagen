Upgr-Inv race:
When Inv to a block arrives while upgr request is in progress. (When corresponding block in L2 gets evicted)
How to respond to Upgr at L2? How to respond to Inv at L1?
NACK -> State busy
NACKE -> block is evicted and dont try Upgr again. Cancel the request
What to do with blocks waiting for that requestNACKE -> block is evicted and dont try Upgr again. Cancel the request
What to do with blocks waiting for that request.

If Inv reaches L1 after NACK response, before sending the request again check if the pending requests for that block contain INV request, if yes then
cancel the Upgr request, invalidate the block, send INV_ACK, change Upgr request to GETX, now either send GETX after setting another timer or now. Maybe doesnot matter.

WB-Inv race:
If L2 Block gets evicted in Modified state, sends inv to L1 owner, and owner also evicts the block. Then on recieving first WB, L2 will completetely
drop the block. L1 will ignore the INV.


Upgr-Upgr race:
L1-L1 deadlock, one waiting for inval-ack while having a pending request of Upgr and other waiting for putx, while having a pending request for inval.

To handle: send a nack from p1 to p2 and a roll back request from p1 to home. when nack send, process pending msgs.
